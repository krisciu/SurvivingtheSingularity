# SurvivingtheSingularity

## What is this?
This is the repository containing class materials for my Surviving the Singularity(also known as Singularity Survival Guide) classes. These classes are done weekly on [My Twitch channel: 1bit2far](https://www.twitch.tv/1bit2far) and aim to provide a guide to the core concepts of modern Machine Learning and Artifical Intelligence technology.

## What do these contain?
These will include Jupyter notebook files as well as any slides used in the presentation, any additional class content will also be added going forward.
